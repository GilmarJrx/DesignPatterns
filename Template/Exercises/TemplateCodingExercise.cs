    //Imagine a typical collectible card game which has cards representing creatures.Each creature has two values: Attack and Health.Creatures can fight each other, dealing their Attack damage, thereby reducing their opponent's health.

    //The class CardGame implements the logic for two creatures fighting one another.However, the exact mechanics of how damage is dealt is different:

    //TemporaryCardDamage : In some games(e.g., Magic: the Gathering), unless the creature has been killed, its health returns to the original value at the end of combat.
    //PermanentCardDamage : In other games(e.g., Hearthstone), health damage persists.
    //You are asked to implement classes TemporaryCardDamageGame and PermanentCardDamageGame that would allow us to simulate combat between creatures.
    //    Some examples:

    //With temporary damage, creatures 1/2 and 1/3 can never kill one another.With permanent damage, second creature will win after 2 rounds of combat.
    //With either temporary or permanent damage, two 2/2 creatures kill one another.
